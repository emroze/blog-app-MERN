          Green Mountain Power, the largest power utility in Vermont, is
          discounting home battery systems for its customers because it also
          reserves the ability to remotely access the homeownerâ€™s battery,
          drawing power back into the grid on hot summer days, when overall
          demand for power is high, and storing power in the home batteries of
          its customers overnight, when demand is low.
